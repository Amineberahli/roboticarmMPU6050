# roboticarmMPU6050
i'm Salim Khazem my project is an Robotic arm 
Robotic arm controlled by hand movement using arduino and MPU6050 
This is a little projet which is an arm robotic controlled by hand movement using MPU6050 sensor
My program is not complete yet, however it works, and it can control 4 servomotors with 3 matricial vector which they are Euler Vector, or if i can say Euler Matrix

################################################

- Theta 

- Psi 

- Phi

for this project i used: 

-Arduino Uno board 
-Sensor MPU6050 6 axis. (accelerometer and gyroscope)
-Servomotors (Tower Pro MG995, Futaba...)
